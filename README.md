# 50 Days, 50 Python Projects 🚀🐍

This repository documents my personal challenge:  
**Building 50 Python projects in 50 days** — covering beginner, intermediate, and slightly advanced levels.  

✅ Goal: Strengthen my coding skills by learning through building.  
✅ Approach: One project per day, no matter how small.  
✅ Outcome: By the end, I’ll have a portfolio of 50 real projects in Python.  

Stay tuned as I keep updating this repo daily! 🚀
